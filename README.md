# Loop-Antennas-for-Wearable-Devices-Optimized-with-High-Impedance-Surface-HIS-Structure
This project investigated the effect of various factors on the performance of 
loop antennas and simulated the effect of the human body on the antenna in a practical application scenario.
Using HIS to address this effect is also proposed and optimized.
